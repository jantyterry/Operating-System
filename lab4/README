1. KNOWN PROBLEMS:

We have tested thoroughly to the best of our abilities, and for this submission we
have not encountered any known problems.


2. DESIGN:

We approach this problem by doing an alternating search through the root directory and 
continously seek to find files. Hence, we read in the image file then continously goes
through every logical clusters until there was no more.

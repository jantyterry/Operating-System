1. KNOWN PROBLEMS:

I have not encountered any known problems, for all the tests I have tried 
with my implementations.


2. DESIGN:

(i) memory shim design:
Using the linked listed data structure appraoched, the list stores the 
memory value along with the size of the memory. The memory is pointed 
to the head of the linked list. The memory is check to see if it is 
freed, and if its not, then the unfreed size is printed out when the 
destructor is called by the library is unloaded.

(ii) sctracer design:
The implemenation of the sctracer is designed to printed out the system 
calls that is used by a program in order of increasing system call number 
such that smallest system call number come first. As well as printing out 
how many time the specific system call was called. Process was created
by forking. Then splitting the user program arguments in tokens then passing 
them to execvp, which will specify the environment explicitly as an argument.
The system calls are kept in a buffer and are printed out to a text file during
execution.

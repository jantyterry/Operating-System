1. KNOWN PROBLEMS:

My allocator is a bit slower than the system allocator but overall it perform at a good speed.


2. DESIGN:
I approach this problem by using a segregated free list. I implement two list for allocations, 
nodeHead and pageHead to hold memory information of size <= 1024. I use mmap system call to allocate
4096 chunks (pages) when size > 1024.
